##Simulation Tests and Results

The tests cover the system at the chosen steady-state and several deviations from the steady-state.   

####Tests at the steady-state
The steady-state is defined by the file SystemSS.json

Tests A are at the steady-state for variables. Test A0 is defined by:   
Test | Fraction of ynom | Tax percentage | Agents | K
---- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------ | -
A0 | 1 | 1 | All | 5
